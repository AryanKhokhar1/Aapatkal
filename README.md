# Aapatkal_updated
Our website will collect data from the hospitalâ€™s staff and show it to the users ,which will tell them about the availability of blood groups, beds, oxygen cylinders and ambulances in each hospital around Rajasthan, for designing the website we have used HTML,CSS ,JS for frontend and django and sqlite3 for back end.
lets get started by clicking on home from the navbar which contains links such as services, about us, sign up ;
home: by clicking on home page we will be redirected to the home page of the website.
About us: this will redirect you to the about us section which tells us about the website
Services: the service option tells us the services provided by the website
The key features are divided into four sections:
1. blood banks
2. ambulance services
3. emergency beds
4. oxygen cylinder
similarly we will add private blood banks details,ambulances service details,oxygen cylinder details in future descriptively.
Clicking on the know details in these section, it will redirect you to an another page, on this hospital page you can see the address , and its geo location, scrolling down it shows the quantity of beds available, blood unit , ambulances, oxygen cylinders available, you can also see the blood groups categories, beds category and so on. 
And with this you can find out the number of available blood unit, normal beds, emergency beds, oxygen cylinder nearby you in one tap.
For this we have used Sqlite3, as we are storing the data manually which will be uploaded on daily basis by the staffs of these organization using sign up page using their staff id, hospital name, address and so on. But later on we will be connecting our database to these organizations database such as hospital database, blood banks database and so on. This will provide automation and we are deciding it to develop to a such phase where we can use this service in all over the india.
thankyou
